Socket API Program Usage
========================



1. SCTP Terminal

A simple SCTP terminal program.

Arguments for sctpterminal:
- [Remote address]
   Address of remote host, including SCTP port number.
   The address and port may be given in text form, which will
   be resolved automatically.
   Examples: 1.2.3.4:7
             1.2.3.4:echo
             host.mydomain.xy:7
             host.mydomain.xy:echo
             [3ffe:400:9600::1:2:3]:7        (RFC 2732 compliant IPv6 format)
             [3ffe:400:9600::1:2:3]:echo     (RFC 2732 compliant IPv6 format)

- {-in=incoming}
   Set maximum number of incoming streams. Default: 1.

- {-out=outgoing}
   Set number of outgoing streams. Default: 1.

- {-force-ipv4|-use-ipv6}
   Enables or disables usage of IPv6.

- {-local=address1} ... {-local=addressN}
   Set local address(es). The address may be given in text form,
   which will be resolved automatically.
   Examples: 127.0.0.1
             [::1]
             localhost
             ipv6-localhost
   If no local address is given, the address of the interface which
   is used for routing to the given destination is used.

- {-notif|-nonotif}
   Enable or disable printing of SCTP notitications.

- {-control|-nocontrol}
   Enable or disable printing of SCTP control data.

- {-color|-nocolor}
   Enable or disable usage of ANSI color codes to display different
   streams, notifications and control data colored for better
   readability.



2. SCTP MultiServer

A multi-threaded SCTP server including echo, discard, daytime,
connect test, TFTP and character generator services.

Arguments for sctpmultiserver:
- {-force-ipv4|-use-ipv6}
   Enables or disables usage of IPv6.

- {-in=incoming}
   Set maximum number of incoming streams. Default: 16.

- {-out=outgoing}
   Set maximum number of outgoing streams. Default: 16.

- {-local=address1} ... {-local=addressn}
   Set local address(es). The address may be given in text form,
   which will be resolved automatically.
   Examples: 127.0.0.1
             [::1]
             localhost
             ipv6-localhost
   If no local address is given, the local addresses are obtained
   automatically from the list of running interfaces (Ethernet, PPP,
   tunnels, ...). The loopback address, multicast addresses,
   IPv6 link local addreses and IPv6 anycast addresses will be
   skipped.

- {-notif|-nonotif}
   Enable or disable printing of SCTP notitications.

- {-control|-nocontrol}
   Enable or disable printing of SCTP control data.

- {-color|-nocolor}
   Enable or disable usage of ANSI color codes to display different
   streams, notifications and control data colored for better
   readability.



3. SCTP TFTP

A TFTP (Trivial File Transfer Protocol) client.


Arguments for sctptftp:
- [Remote address]
   Address of remote host, including SCTP port number.
   The address and port may be given in text form, which will
   be resolved automatically.
   Examples: 1.2.3.4:69
             1.2.3.4:tftp
             host.mydomain.xy:69
             host.mydomain.xy:tftp
             [3ffe:400:9600::1:2:3]:69      (RFC 2732 compliant IPv6 format)
             [3ffe:400:9600::1:2:3]:tftp    (RFC 2732 compliant IPv6 format)

- [get|put]
   Do download (get) or upload (put).

- [Filename]
   Filename for upload or download.

- {-force-ipv4|-use-ipv6}
   Enables or disables usage of IPv6.

- {-local=address1} ... {-local=addressn}
   Set local address(es). The address may be given in text form,
   which will be resolved automatically.
   Examples: 127.0.0.1
             [::1]
             localhost
             ipv6-localhost
   If no local address is given, the local addresses are obtained
   automatically from the list of running interfaces (Ethernet, PPP,
   tunnels, ...). The loopback address, multicast addresses,
   IPv6 link local addreses and IPv6 anycast addresses will be
   skipped.



4. SCTP Test

A simple test program demonstrating the usage of the C++ SCTP Socket
classes for connection-oriented (TCP-like) and connection-less (UDP-like)
SCTP usage.
NOTE: The class Socket is a wrapper for the SCTP Socket classes AND
      system socket functionality (socket(), bind(), ...). Therefore,
      it can also be used for TCP, UDP, Unix sockets, ... .
      The usage of this class is demonstrated in the SCTP Socket Test
      program (sctpsockettest, see section 4).


Arguments for sctptest:
- [-force-ipv4|-use-ipv6]
   Enables or disables usage of IPv6.
   NOTE: The current default behavior is disabling IPv6!

- [-server|-client]
   Start in server or client mode.

-[-connectionless|-cl | -connectionoriented|-co]
   Use connection-less (UDP-like) or connection-oriented (TCP-like) mode.

- [-local=address1] ... [-local=addressN]
   Set local address(es). The address may be given in text form,
   which will be resolved automatically.
   Examples: 127.0.0.1
             [::1]
             localhost
             ipv6-localhost

- [-remote=address1] ... [-remote=addressN]
   Set remote address(es). The address may be given in text form,
   which will be resolved automatically.
   Examples: 127.0.0.1
             [::1]
             remotehost
             ipv6-remotehost

Connection-less Example:
Server: ./sctptest -server -cl -local=132.252.150.160
Client: ./sctptest -client -cl -local=132.252.150.151 -remote=132.252.150.160

Connection-oriented Example:
Server: ./sctptest -server -co -local=132.252.150.160
Client: ./sctptest -client -co -local=132.252.150.151 -remote=132.252.150.160



5. SCTP Socket Test

A simple test program demonstrating the usage of the C++ Socket
classes for connection-oriented (TCP-like) and connection-less (UDP-like)
SCTP usage. The arguments are the same as for SCTP Test. The Socket class
also supports other protocols like TCP, UDP and Unix sockets.
